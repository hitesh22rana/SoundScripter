# SoundScripter üîäüìù

Simplify and Automate your transcription workflow with SoundScripter

## Features

- **Media Transcription:** Convert media files (audio/video) to text with high accuracy.
- **Scalable:** Utilizes a distributed architecture to handle multiple requests in parallel.
- **Real-time Notifications:** Uses Redis Pub-Sub and Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time notifications

## Architecture

SoundScripter's architecture is designed to handle transcription requests efficiently. Here's how it works:

1. **User Requests:** Users uploads video/audio files for transcription through API.

2. **Optimization:** Media files are optimized to be utilized for transcription service.

3. **RabbitMQ Message Broker:** Transcription requests are added to the RabbitMQ message broker.

4. **Celery Task Queue:** Celery task queues manages and distribute the tasks. When new tasks are added to the queue, Celery workers pick them up and process them asynchronously and concurrently.

5. **Task Execution:** Each task runs in its own container, allowing for parallel processing of multiple tasks based on the system configuration.

6. **Realtime Notifications:** SoundScripter leverages Redis Pub-Sub and Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time notifications.
